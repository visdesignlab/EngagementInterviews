In this method, we introduce workshop participants and facilitators through analogy. For example, we all respond to the prompt: _“if you were to describe yourself as an animal, what would you be?”_ We have used other analogies, such as superheroes (to increase a feeling of _agency_) and plants (when plants were relevant to the _topic_).

\\
This method encourages self-expression and demonstrates vulnerability  --- both of which can help to establish _trust_, _agency_, and _collegiality_. It also primes participants to think in analogies, which is a key part of creative thinking. We have typically paired this method with another introduction to more explicitly establish the _topic_, such as Creativity Guidelines.

\\
We have used this method in a number of our workshops [P2,P4 - P8]. Participants may see this method as high _challenge_ because the analogy can seem silly. In our experience, leading the method by example can help to reduce the _challenge_ and build _trust_ with participants.
